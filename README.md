# Truth_tables_Qt
Application to create truth tables for differrent expressions, using language C and opportunities of Qt framework. 
The algorithm of making a postfix expression is based on algorithm of sorting stations, all priorities of operators and existence of brakes are considered to create correct Truth table. 
If expression is not correct program will show a message with description of wrong input

It is first big(for me) project and of course the are moments that should be written better
